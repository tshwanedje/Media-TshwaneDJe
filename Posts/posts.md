TRAINING: TLex/tlTerm Training Duration Guideline (depending on your budget and needs):
* 4 to 8 hours training is good for briefly covering 'the core basics' of TLex/tlTerm as a starter training suggested for most clients with a modest training budget
* 1 to 2 hours training "if that's all you can budget", or just need to cover a few specific requested topics
* 3-day training (24 hours = 3 days x 8 hours) (or 2 to 4 days) is the recommended good general training option, for organizations/teams (with a decent training budget), for good coverage of topics and to get the most value and "return on investment" from the software. This option also allows time for us to hear feedback and questions from users during training, to analyze data and other project-specific requirements, and start assisting with some TLex/tlTerm customization, such as setting up project-specific fields/languages/styles and lists
Payments are handled by Payfast, for "safe and secure online payments", also supporting instant EFT in South Africa & many more payment methods. You can also pay by PayPal (using the link in the page below), or bank transfer to our US$, EUR or Rand accounts.

@d_joffe
Want a new feature added to TLex, tlTerm, tlCorpus, tlEditor/tlDatabase etc. for your project (or existing feature changed or extended)?

I'm happy to do this as long as you can just pay my hours. Small feature changes may require only a few hours sometimes - ask me to estimate.

DJ: Thanks, that looks great except I'm thinking maybe the conversion rate will be low as people must fill in a general contact form, wait for a response, maybe they forget about it or we don't reply quickly, or maybe they have other worries or anxieties that aren't allayed ... what if we make the link to the order form to already order support/training?
