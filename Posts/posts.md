DJ: Thanks, that looks great except I'm thinking maybe the conversion rate will be low as people must fill in a general contact form, wait for a response, maybe they forget about it or we don't reply quickly, or maybe they have other worries or anxieties that aren't allayed ... what if we make the link to the order form to already order support/training? But they may have worries like questions they first want answered ...
